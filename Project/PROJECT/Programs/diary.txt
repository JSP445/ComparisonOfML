Fixed the main menu. It now loops until the user presses exit. Also fixed some errors showing up in the program by adding
zero division flag set to true.

28/01/2024

Created the option to choose between different datasets. Some of the algorithms still need tuning to work with different
sets.

31/01/2024

Added other algorithms to main module. Logistic Regresion and Decision Trees need some further tuning.

17/02/2024

Added cross validation scores custom implementation. Need to rewrite Logistic Regression and start implementing ROC curves.

1/03/2024

Rewrote Logistic Regression for better results. Need to implement ROC Curves and consider adding new dataset options.

12/03/2024

Created implementation of ROC Curves. Going to add more dataset options.

19/03/2024

Added more dataset options.
